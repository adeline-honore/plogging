# Plogging
This project is the last project, the final bouquet, of my training as an iOS Application Developer with OpenClassrooms.

Its objective is to code an iOS application that responds to a real problem

The application is in Swift, uses the MVC pattern, has unit tests, an online continuous deployment solution (GitHub Actions),

The Plogging application can be used on all iPhone sizes.

## What is plogging?
Plogging is the sporting practice that combines running and waste collection.

This project allows the organization of plogging races
